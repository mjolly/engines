README for MathpakAppGen tool
-----------------------------

What is the MathpakAppGen tool?
-------------------------------

MathpakAppGen is a tool that allows a developer to generate a Mathpak 
Application definition file and directory structure.

Why do I (not) need it?
-----------------------

You do not need this tool if you compose your applications on the 
developer.mathpak.com website. If you use the website, it will
take care of generating an application definition file and the
directory structure for you.

If you do not wish to use the developer.mathpak.com website you 
can use this tool to generate an application defintion file and 
directory structure. Note, however, that you will not be able to 
use other developers components (unless you know their names).

If you plan to make your app available on the mathpak.com site, then be aware
that you will need to recompose the app on the developer site.
At some point, we plan to add the ability fro a developer to import an 
application developer file generated by this tool, to the site.

The best use of this tool is when you have a large number of 
components of your own in your app. You can compose your apps 
during your development phase using this tool and then build your 
app on the development site when  it is reasonably stable.

How do I run it?
----------------

Set your MATHPAK_STAGING variable to your staging directory
cd $MATHPAK_STAGING
python ./engine/tools/MathpakAPpGen.py

Follow the menu options

Does it work?
-------------

Yes, but its very elementary in function. It allows create, review, update, 
delete  operations on the app struture (app, code, data) and loading, generation 
of app files and generation of a directory structure. There is very little 
validation of fields.

Known bugs
---------

- Various field validation issues
- Tool crashes if app definition file exceeds screen size
